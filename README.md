# Hidden scratch blocks file

Scratch Addons idea
------

Name: Hidden Blocks Category Addon
------

Why this would be helpful: Advanced users often need the built-in but hidden Scratch blocks like while, for each, and counter blocks for more optimized coding.

------

How this addon works: I suggest adding a new addon that enables a dedicated category (Red color) in the blocks palette containing:

event_whentouchingobject

control_for_each

control_while

control_get_counter

control_incr_counter

control_clear_counter

operator_round

colour_picker

text_attributes_menu

the id of the red block is random numbers

.sb3 file with hidden blocks: https://github.com/yotomir/hidden_scratch_blocks_file/releases/download/sb3/Scratch.hidden.blocks.sb3

------

Possible alternatives: Using browser console scripts, but an official addon would be much more stable and user-friendly for the community.
